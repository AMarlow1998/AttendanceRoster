# AttendanceRoster
By AMarlow1998

Purpose: 
Easily manage the attendance status of a group of people for your event.

Features:
Lightweight - 14KB
Easy to use!

W.I.P
Add feature to check all boxes
Test Linux compatibility.

Usage:

Manual Adding: Click File>New to bring up a popup. You can name your file and then select the amount of rows you want.
Open: If you already have a file full of people from a previous session, you can open and edit that instead.
Save: Saves the file as a .csv spreadsheet.

Caveats: 
I only designed this to work with .csv files. Most table-style files can be easily converted to .csv however(xml files easily convert to CSV for example).
I'm sure I've missed some functionality and it will glitch from time to time. Let me know when this happens and I'll try to update it.
